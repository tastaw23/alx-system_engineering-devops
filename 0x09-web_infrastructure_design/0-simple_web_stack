Explanation:
Server:

A physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure.
Domain Name:

Acts as a human-readable address for the website (www.foobar.com).
Maps to the server's IP (8.8.8.8) using DNS.
DNS Record for www:

The www in www.foobar.com is a subdomain and is typically a CNAME record that points to the main domain's A record.
Web Server:

Nginx, in this case, handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and acts as a reverse proxy for the application server.
Application Server:

Manages the dynamic aspects of the website, executes the application logic, and generates dynamic content.
Database:

MySQL stores and manages the website's data, providing a persistent storage solution.
Communication:

The server communicates with the user's computer over HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The entire infrastructure relies on a single server; if it fails, the entire website goes down.
Downtime during Maintenance:

Performing maintenance, such as deploying new code, requires restarting the web server, causing downtime.
Limited Scalability:

The infrastructure may struggle to handle high traffic loads; scaling is challenging with only one server.
