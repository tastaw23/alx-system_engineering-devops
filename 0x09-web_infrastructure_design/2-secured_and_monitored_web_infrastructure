Whiteboard Design:
User Access:

Start with a user wanting to access the secured website www.foobar.com.
Components:

Firewall 1, 2, and 3:
Placed between the internet and servers to control incoming and outgoing traffic, enhancing security.
SSL Certificate:
Installed to enable HTTPS, encrypting data in transit between users and the server.
Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):
Collect and send data to a monitoring service (e.g., Sumologic).
Server 1, 2, and 3:
Consist of web servers (Nginx), application servers, and MySQL databases.
Explanation:

Firewalls:

Added for security, controlling and monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic. Each server is protected by a firewall.
SSL Certificate (HTTPS):

Enables secure communication by encrypting data between the user's browser and the server, preventing eavesdropping.
Monitoring:

Monitors the health, performance, and security of the infrastructure in real-time.
Data collectors on each server gather metrics and logs for analysis by the monitoring service.
Monitoring Data Collection:

Utilize data collectors on each server to gather metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, error logs, etc.
This data is sent to the monitoring service (Sumologic), where it can be analyzed.
Monitoring Web Server QPS:

Monitor the web server's QPS (Queries Per Second) by collecting metrics related to incoming HTTP requests.
Set up alerts for unusual spikes or drops in QPS to detect and address potential issues.
Issues with the Infrastructure:
Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:

Termination at the load balancer exposes decrypted traffic within the internal network, potentially compromising security.
Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:

A single point of failure and potential performance bottleneck if the MySQL server becomes overwhelmed with write requests.
Uniform Servers (Same Components):

Uniformity might lead to a lack of diversity and increased vulnerability; a single flaw could affect all servers simultaneously.
